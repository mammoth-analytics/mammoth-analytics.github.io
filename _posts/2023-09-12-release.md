### Enhancements:

#### Introducing Mammoth's Enhanced Collaboration Features: Projects, Workspaces, and Seamless Data Sharing:
In our latest Collaboration update, we're excited to introduce Projects, a powerful addition that transforms Mammoth's collaboration capabilities. With Projects, existing customers are seamlessly migrated into collaborative workspaces, streamlining data sharing and teamwork. Now, you and your team can efficiently work together on the same datasets, eliminating the need for shared login credentials.

Key Features of Projects:

* Share: Invite your workspace members to collaborate on your project.
* Collaborate: Join a project as a collaborator by invitation.
* Permissions: Easily manage collaborators' roles and permissions within your projects.
