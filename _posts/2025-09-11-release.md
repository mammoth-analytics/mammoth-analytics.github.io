### Product Enhancement :

* Preserve Join Configuration – Join settings (key columns, selected columns, join type) are now preserved when switching between foreign tables with a similar schema, reducing the need to reconfigure joins from scratch.
* Draft Mode State Display – Draft mode state is now clearly shown in the pipeline as “Draft Mode – ON” or “Draft Mode – OFF” so users are always aware whether changes are temporary or persistent.
* Updated Metrics Design – Metric cards have a refreshed clean and modern look for better readability and improved presentation of data insights.

### Defect Fixes:
Resolved the following issues :
* Unable to apply rules or pipeline changes after adding data when the view is in draft mode.
* Copy Multiple Columns rule showed incorrect behavior when edited.
* Activity Log displayed an unclear message when no activities are present in the selected interval.
* Find & Replace function panel did not scroll to newly added fields when clicking "Add more" button, causing a confusing user experience.
