### Enhancements
#### Improved Regex Error Handling (An alpha feature on request)
* Mammoth improved the handling of regex errors in the Extract Text rule by implementing a validator to disallow invalid regex, such as ], [A-Z{1,3}. Spaces to be matched now have to be explicitly mentioned with a preceeding backslash. <space> changes to <backslash><space>
