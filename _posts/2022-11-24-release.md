### Enhancements

#### Support for join with different column types.
Mammoth now allows for doing join even if data types are different. This is now
supported for joining text with numeric columns and vice versa. When such a join
is done, Mammoth internally casts the joined key column to the expected type.

#### Support for Single sign on
Mammoth now support its customers to sign in with Google besides email and password based authentication.
