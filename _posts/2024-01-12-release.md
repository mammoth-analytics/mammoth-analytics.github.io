### Optimizations:
#### Support for Varied Numeric Separators in Column Type Conversion:
Mammoth now permits diverse numeric separators in column type conversion, accommodating both Indian and US styles. With this update, Mammoth supports conversions in formats such as "x,xx,xxx" and "xx,xx,xxx.

### Defect Fixes:
* Resolved an issue where the Data Flow Status - Queued section was not visible when branching out to a project.
* Fixed the problem where renamed date columns were downloaded as text columns instead of date columns.
* Addressed the issue where applying the Show Top/Bottom rows rule was ineffective due to the sort being inherited from grid sort.
* Fixed the bug in view deletion, ensuring that incorrect views are not deleted, and the view menu no longer appears in the left corner when it shouldn't.
