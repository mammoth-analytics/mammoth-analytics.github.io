### Product Enhancement :

* Integrated PDF to CSV and Image to CSV capabilities within Mammoth. Users can now upload PDF files and images, extract data from tables using intents, and convert the extracted content directly into CSV files. This streamlines data extraction from structured documents into actionable datasets.
* Improved file scanning performance and reliability by optimizing how antivirus checks are handled during file uploads.
* Convert Column Type rule: Now defaults to comma as the delimiter and auto-applies the last used format for repeated conversions.
* Improved activity logging with enhanced event coverage and UI fixes.
* Improved intent-based task application to apply tasks immediately unless pipeline is in Draft Mode.

### Defect Fixes :
Resolved the following issues:

* Settings – Members were unable to delete their own profiles.
* Searching within the Explore card showed a loader before reacting, causing a delayed user experience.
* Newly added users to a workspace encountered errors when accepting invitations in projects with many existing members.
* Settings – API Keys were not workspace-scoped, allowing unintended cross-workspace access.
* The Convert Column rule’s task description displayed incorrect information.
* Draft mode was incorrectly entering a dirty state even when there were no pending changes in the pipeline.
