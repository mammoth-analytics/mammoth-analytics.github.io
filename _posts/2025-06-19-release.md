### Product Enhancement :

* Introduced an intent-based condition builder that allows users to define filter or transformation conditions using natural language. The system interprets the intent and auto-generates the corresponding structured logic.
* Added support for managing external API keys from the Settings page. Keys like OpenAI can be added here, though access is gated by availability of Gen AI features.
