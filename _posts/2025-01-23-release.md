### Defect Fixes:
* Resolved an issue with opening the batch section when there are many batches, causing the loader to appear and the tab to crash.
* Resolved an issue with editing join rules that incorrectly set the prefix and join type to defaults.
* Resolved an issue where filters on the Explore card could not be edited when there was a long list or multiple values selected.
* Resolved an issue where the Edit Query modal failed to make a future request call when there were many tables in the table list, resulting in slow load times.
* Resolved an issue where empty Explore cards were shown for missing columns, causing the grid to display an infinite loader.
