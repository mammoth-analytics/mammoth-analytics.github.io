### Enhancements:
* Data usage now tracks row counts instead of data size, with restrictions applied at the workspace level to stop Mammoth usage when limits are exceeded.
* Removed webhooks from the 'Add Data' options for self-serve users.
### Defect Fixes:
* Resolved an issue where MSSQL data pull failed due to UTF-16-LE encoding problems.
