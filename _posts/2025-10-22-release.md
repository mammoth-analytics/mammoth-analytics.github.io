### Product Enhancement :

* Column Placement: when copying or adding a new column, the new column now appears immediately next to the original one instead of at the far right, improving context and usability.
* Join Function: users can now copy a Join rule and reuse it across different workspaces or projects.
* Send to Dataset: Branch-out operations have been optimized for faster performance and improved reliability.
* Export as CSV: improvements made to the Explore Cards export flow for better performance.

### Defect Fixes :
Resolved the following issues:

* Explore Card: the Apply button in the Show Values By modal was not functioning.
* Activity Log: deleted (Untitled) projects are now disabled and show a hover message indicating theyâ€™re no longer accessible.
* Intercom Chat: messages remained visible after logout; chat history now clears correctly.
