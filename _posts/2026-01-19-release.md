### Product Enhancement :

* Third-Party Data Pull- Added Replace and Combine options next to the dataset name, allowing better control over how incoming data updates existing datasets.
* File upload progress widget – Introduced a file upload progress widget to provide clear visibility into ongoing uploads, including better handling of long file names.
* Move webhooks to left sidebar – Webhooks are now available as a dedicated option in the left sidebar, improving accessibility during dataset creation.
* New Data Library empty state and drag-and-drop experience – Updated the empty Data Library view and improved drag-and-drop behavior for a smoother data onboarding flow.
* Maintain scroll and preview state across views – Scroll position and data preview state are now preserved when navigating between different views in the pipeline, enabling smoother data exploration.

### Defect Fixes :
Resolved the following issues:

* Fixed an issue where users were able to create an orchestration without selecting a project.
* Fixed an issue where the last selected project continued to appear even after the user had left all projects within a workspace.
* Fixed an issue where image names appeared excessively long when images were uploaded via URL.
* Resolved a validation issue in Generate Dataset with AI (Beta) where entering a float value for rows neither showed an error nor allowed the flow to continue.
* Improved user feedback for webhook-based dataset creation by indicating when the dataset is still being created before it appears on the landing page.
* Fixed a copy-paste issue in Join when pasting into a different workspace where the foreign view had a non-matching schema.
* Restricted dataset creation when no project is present in the workspace.
* Updated sample file uploads by disabling Create New Dataset for the Credit Risk Assessment sample and removing the Clinical Research Pipeline file.
* Fixed the Cancel button issue in the SFTP edit pull-method modal.
* Restored the Retrieve latest data icon for datasets pulled via SFTP.
* Fixed an issue where Branch Out was copied to an incorrect position.
* Resolved data ingestion issues affecting file settings during dataset setup.
* Fixed a bug in the Edit Data Settings modal related to unstructured data.
* Pasting an action copied from a step that was not marked as the end of the pipeline was resulting in an error.
