### Enhancements:
#### BigQuery export - partitioning on date columns.
Mammoth now supports partitioning on date columns when exporting to Big Query. This helps reduce query costs for time series data while making the queries faster.

### Defect Fixes:
* Resolved an issue where a continuous loader was displayed on the Data landing page when a user, logged into multiple workspaces and attempted to log in after logging out from another workspace.
* Resolved issues related to the propagation and renaming of column names in Join rule.
* Addressed an issue where "00:00:00+00" was erroneously getting added after the date value.
* "%Y-%m-%d %I:%M:%S.%f" format was removed from the Label & Insert Values and Increment/Decrement Date Values, as it lacked information about AM and PM.
