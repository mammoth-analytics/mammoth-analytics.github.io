### Enhancements:
#### BigQuery export - partitioning on date columns.
Users can now enable partitioning on date columns when exporting to BigQuery for enhanced efficiency and cost savings.

### Defect Fixes:
* Resolved an issue where a continuous loader was displayed on the Data landing page when a user, logged into multiple workspaces and attempted to log in after logging out from another workspace.
* Resolved issues related to the propagation and renaming of column names within the joins workflow.
* Addressed an issue where "00:00:00+00" was erroneously getting added after the date value.
* "%Y-%m-%d %I:%M:%S.%f" format was removed from the Label & Insert Values and Increment/Decrement Date Values, as it lacked information about AM and PM.
