### Enhancement:
* Combine dataset modal shows longer column names as wrapped in multiple lines. This takes away the need to hover ellipsised names. Added search for column names. Also, a selector for unmatched columns has been put.
* Improvements to onboarding flow for self serve users.

### Defect Fixes:
* Resolved an issue where projects and datasets were not visible in the settings area.
