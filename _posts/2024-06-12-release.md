### Enhancement:
* Combine dataset modal shows longer column names as wrapped in multiple lines. This takes away the need to hover ellipsised names. Search for column names has been added. Also, a selector for unmatched columns is put for easier access.
* Improvements to onboarding flow for self serve users.

### Defect Fixes:
* Resolved an issue where projects and datasets were not visible in the settings area.
