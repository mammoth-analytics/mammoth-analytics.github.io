### Enhancements

#### Salesforce integration support for sandbox salesforce domain.
In Mammoth Salesforce does support custom domains in addition to the main salesforce.com domain.

#### In 3P connectors, allow for latest batch pull to replace existing batch data in Mammoth.
Mammoth allows for incremental data pull based on unique sequence column.However, the data that is pulled is kept in combine mode where every pull creates a new batch of data.Now besides the option to create a new batch, Mammoth is allowing the user an option to replace the data with the new increment.This reduces the amount of data stored in Mammoth and avoids redundant processing
