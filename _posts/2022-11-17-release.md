### Enhancements

#### Support for custom domains for Salesforce integration.
Mammoth now supports salesforce sign-in for custom domains besides the main salesforce domain.

#### Third-party connectors in Mammoth now allow for replacing data in the dataset with new rows of data in the remote data store.
If you have a table in your database to which rows are added periodically and you want to process only the latest rows in Mammoth, you can do this now. Earlier you could pull the latest rows in Mammoth but you would keep all in Mammoth (using the Combine mode in data pulls). Now, Mammoth allows you to pull the latest batch of data in the remote table in replace mode.
