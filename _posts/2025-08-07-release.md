### Product Enhancement :

* Data Editor Grid: Introduced freeze column functionality in the Data Editor grid to improve data navigation.
* Explore Cards â€“ Multi-select Behavior: Enhanced selection logic in Explore cards. Clicking on an already selected item using `ctrl/shift` now deselects only that item while preserving other selections.

### Defect Fixes:
* Resolved an issue where manually editing date values in cells resulted in an error.
* Fixed a bug in user settings where clicking on the cookies section had no effect.
