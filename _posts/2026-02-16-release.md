### Product Enhancement :

#### Join Rule – Match Within Range Support –

#### Edit Cells Header UI Enhancement – 
Updated the Edit Cells header experience with improved visual clarity, better editing state visibility, and refined layout and button presentation for a cleaner and more intuitive interaction.

* Preview Panel did not load for views in the Data Library and remained in a loading state.
* Dataset renaming did not behave as expected in certain scenarios.
