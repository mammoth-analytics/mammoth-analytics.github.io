### Product Enhancement :

* **Orchestration – Revamped Automation Module**  
  We’ve replaced the previous Automation feature with a new Orchestration panel that brings all workflow operations into a single, organized interface.  
  It now includes:

  * **Dataset Refresh** – Fetch the latest third-party dataset updates manually or on a schedule.
  * **Data Consolidation** – Combine or replace dataset data when new files are uploaded.
  * **Messaging** – Configure automated notifications for workflow updates.
  * **File Collection** – Visible in the interface and will be enabled in a future release.

* **Bulk Replace** – Added controls allowing users to choose whether search should be case-sensitive and whether fuzzy search is applied.

### Defect Fixes :
Resolved the following issues:

* Settings – User Management – Fixed an issue where the entire UI became disabled when a search returned no results.
