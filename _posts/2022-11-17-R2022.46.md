## **PRODUCT UPDATES:**

### **Enhancement:**
1.Salesforce integration support for sandbox salesforce domain:
  Salesforce supports only main domain of salesforce.Now we are allowing the user to use it for custom domains too .
  
2.In 3P connectors, allow for latest batch pull to replace existing batch data in Mammoth:
  Mammoth allows for incremental data pull based on unique sequence column.However, the data that is pulled is kept in combine mode where every pull creates a new batch of data.Now besides the option to create a new batch, we are allowing the user an option to replace the data with the new increment.
  This reduces the amount of data stored in Mammoth and avoids redundant processing.

### **Bug fixes:**

1.Pipeline was showing loader and preventing access to task menu.
