### Enhancements

#### Mammoth now supports duplicating Views when duplicating Datasets.
When a user duplicates a data source,now they can choose to duplicate the data itself as well as any views and pipelines associated with the data source. This can save time and effort by allowing users to quickly create copies of existing data sources and their associated views and pipelines.

### Defect fixes

* Clicking on the Mammoth icon opened the root folder in the Data Library. Now the Dataset name is clickable and opens the folder in  which the Dataset exists. Clicking on the Mammoth icon continues to open the root folder.
* Reset the view throws incorrect notification.
