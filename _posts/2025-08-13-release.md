### Product Enhancement :

* BigQuery improvements: added dataset/table restrictions, import flexibility, and better credential handling.
* Improved global search to ensure all projects and resources are discoverable.
* Enhanced user invitations: bulk invite now supports multiple delimiters and up to 250 addresses at once.
* Better handling of pasted values in input boxes â€” pasted content with separators now splits correctly into multiple values.

### Defect Fixes:
Resolved the following issues :
* Settings page: Alpha/Beta toggle was not being retained after refresh.
* Pipeline in Draft mode: When submitting a draft with only action changes, tasks were unnecessarily re-executed. Now tasks run only if task-related changes are made.
