### Product Enhancement :

* Copy New Columns – Updated the design to align with the latest UI specifications.
* Conditional Filter – The toggle for “Remove” mode now dynamically adjusts based on interpreted intent. Previously, the backend defaulted to “Keep” even for semantic “Remove” operations.

### Defect Fixes :
Resolved the following issues:

* Add or Replace Data – When combining with an existing file that has a long name, the full name was not visible on hover.
* Fixed an issue where spaces in labels (for example, in phrases like “to”) were being removed automatically.
* Remove Duplicate Rule – Copy-pasting the rule did not retain the selected columns to exclude.
* Find & Replace – When reopening the rule for modification, the columns to be reviewed did not appear.
* Data Source Rename – Renaming a dataset by only changing the case failed with a duplicate name error.
* SFTP Data Source – Changing the setting from “Combine” to “Replace” in the preview panel caused a continuous loader.
* Dataset Properties – Fixed property-related issues for SFTP connector datasets.
