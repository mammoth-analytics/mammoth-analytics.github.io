### Enhancements:

#### Date difference calculation - Now calculate difference from current time:
The date difference rule now allows to calculate date difference between values in a date column and current time.

#### Label and Insert rule now allows inserting current time in date column:
The label and insert rule has now been updated to allow for inserting the current time besides any static time that one could previously enter through the calendar widget. The current time is re-evaulated every time the specific label insert task run.

#### Folder deletion now gracefully deletes all its items:
Earlier folder deletion would leave out those items in it which had some dependencies on other items. Now the deletion is complete and all its contents are removed. No residual items like datasets and folders remain.

#### Signing in to a workspace after a break will show a instance warm up information box:
When a User is away and there is no activity ina workspace the underlying compute is suspended. We now show an information modal when user activates a workspace. The modal informs that the workspace is getting ready.

### Defect Fixes:
* Resolved an issue where ongoing folder deletions prevented users from performing other operations. 
* Resolved an issue where user were not able to create sftp identity using an SSH key.
* When metrics have current time in condition, metric won't show it correctly. This is now fixed
* When user uploads multiple files to a folder, and then moves away from that folder, some of the pending files would get uploaded to the new folder. This is now fixed.
* Deleted projects no longer continue to appear in the sidebar.
* Resolved the issue where the renaming of columns was not performing as expected.
* Fixed the problem where the Window function did not display the N value correctly from the NTILE function during modification.
* Addressed the issue where the Join rule was stuck and not working correctly.
