### Enhancements

#### Provide support for combine/replace options in SFTP pulls based on date patterns in file names.
Mammoth now support for combine/replace options in SFTP.User can choose periodicity and decides append or replace option there.
If user selects one time, the user just pulls the specific file and is done.


### Defect fixes

* When a file type dataset was added with new batch the dataset source type became to append type.
* Explore Card Summary AVG was showing wrong value. 


### Internal Improvements
* There is a requirement to be able to group and replace longer words with more than 5-6 letter difference between them.Now we are   allowing a user(specific) to modify this threshold value from within “bulk replace” function panel and rerun the autofill.
