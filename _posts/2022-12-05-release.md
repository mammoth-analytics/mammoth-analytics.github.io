### Enhancements

#### Provide support for append/replace options in SFTP pulls based on date patterns in file names.
Mammoth now supports option to append or replace options on its SFTP connector. 
If user selects one time pull, Mammoth just pulls the specific file once. If period option is chosen and the User provides a date pattern on file
names. The latest file matching date pattern is picked for append or replace into the Dataset at the end of every period.

### Defect fixes

* When a file type dataset was added with new batch the dataset source type became to append type.
* Explore Card Summary Average shows incorrect value in some scenarios. 
* Selecting columns in the grid does not select the columns in column browser.

### Beta features
* Bulk replace rule in Mammoth has supported fuzzy search for long. With this enhancement the User can now control the fuzziness threshold themselves.
