### Defect fixes

* The column browser should stay disabled when the pipeline has an error. This has been fixed now.
* Added tooltip messages for disabled items when the pipeline is in error.
* Added an error message when the user tries to delete a View which has been used in a join rule elsewhere.
* When the column name is long, the data type is not visible in the Report. This has been fixed.
