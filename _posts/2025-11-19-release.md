### Product Enhancement :

  * Smart Auto-Layout – AI chooses the best layout and places widgets using a responsive 12-column grid.

  * Dashboard Themes – Includes 10 professionally designed themes for quick, consistent styling.
  * Responsive Design – Dashboards adapt seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
  * Conversational Editing – Modify dashboards using natural language (“add revenue trend”, “switch to dark theme”).
  * Data-Aware Query Generation – AI builds optimized queries with correct aggregations, grouping, and validations.
  * HTML Export – Export dashboards as standalone HTML files with embedded components.
  * Interactive Exploration – Supports drill-downs, element-based filtering, and intuitive reset options.

### Defect Fixes :
Resolved the following issues:

* Pipeline Tasks – The tooltip for task creation and modification did not show user details when the user was no longer part of the workspace; this has now been fixed to display accurate creation/modification information even for absent users.
* Automation Details – Dataset names were not displayed with correct letter casing.
