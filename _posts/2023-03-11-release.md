### Enhancements

#### Revamped BigQuery Connector for Better User Experience
* Now, users can remove and edit a BigQuery service file in the export section. Also, multiple service files can be added.
* Enhanced warning system: If a user creates an export that will overwrite data already exported from another view, a warning message will appear on validation. The user will be asked to confirm if this is intentional before proceeding further.


### Defect fixes

* Resolved an issue where the BigQuery table name was not displayed in error notifications.
* Addresses an issue in the Connectors Modal where the list of columns was not followed by the data type in the drop-down of unique sequence columns.
* Resolved a problem where SFTP took too long to list files.
* Addresses an issue in the Edit Query Modal that prevented it from opening or displaying older datasets without continuous loading.
