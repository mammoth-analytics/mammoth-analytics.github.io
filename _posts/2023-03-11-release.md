### Enhancements

#### Smart combine on Big Query is now available as an alpha feature (on request)
* Now, users can remove and edit a BigQuery service file in the export section. Also, multiple service files can be added.
* Introduced a feature called Smart combine. This allows users to merge new data into an existing exported table. If the same set of key columns is reported, the corresponding values are updated. If a new set of key columns come in, they are now added to the table. Supported on Big Query.

### Defect fixes

* Resolved an issue where the BigQuery table name was not displayed in error notifications.
* Fixed an issue in the dropdown for the Unique sequence column in the Connectors modal where the names of the column in the list were missing column type suffixes.
* Resolved a problem where SFTP took too long to list files.
* Addresses an issue in the Edit Query Modal that prevented it from opening or displaying older datasets without continuous loading.
