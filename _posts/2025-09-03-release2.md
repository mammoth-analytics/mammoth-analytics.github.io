### Product Enhancement :

* Introduced Activity Log (Initial Release) â€“ a workspace-level log to track user activities (datasets, views, projects, automation, etc.) with search and export options for easy auditing. Added filtering to refine results by timeframe and activity type. Currently, only key events are captured; more events will be added in future releases.
