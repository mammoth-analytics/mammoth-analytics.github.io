### Enhancements:

#### Restrictions and Advanced Settings:
The latest enhancement in Mammoth introduces usage restrictions based on subscription plans while also offering an advanced settings page. Users are now limited in data uploads, processing, user creation, and access to third-party connectors, aligning with their subscribed plan. Additionally, users can manage their workspaces, projects, users, profile, billing, and more with our advanced settings page. 

### Defect Fixes:
* Fixed an issue where the application became sluggish and dataview pages became unresponsive.
