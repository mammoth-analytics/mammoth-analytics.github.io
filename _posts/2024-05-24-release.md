### Enhancement:

#### Mammoth self-serve phase-1:
We are expanding Mammoth, our B2B enterprise product, to include B2C customers. In Phase 1, we have introduced:

- Registration page
- Workspace creation loading flow
- Verification email page
- Handling for scheduling option unavailability
- Review of welcome and verification email templates
- Removal of upgrade CTAs

#### Back Button on Export Modal:
A back button has been added to the export modal for improved navigation.

#### Combo Word Passwords:
Mammoth now allows combo word passwords (e.g., Orange_hat_21). These passwords, which were previously restricted, are now accepted as level 3 complexity is deemed sufficient for Mammoth's needs.

### Defect Fixes:
* Resolved an issue where the Mammoth logo in received emails appeared broken.
* Fixed an issue preventing the closure of the preview panel for certain datasets.
* Addressed a problem where the webhook data refresh icon showed a significant delay, causing incorrect assumptions that data had not been received.
