### Enhancements:

#### Edit Column Mapping in Branch Out to Projects
Users can now edit column mappings when branching out to projects.

#### Collaboration Indicator
Introducing the Collaboration Indicator! Users' names actively working on a view are now displayed at the bottom, offering a quick glance at ongoing collaboration efforts.

### Defect Fixes:
* Addressed an issue where the "Create Folder" button and workspace name erroneously appeared when there was no project.
* Resolved an issue where MSSQL exports were failing due to text columns in the dataset.
* Addressed an issue in Export to BigQuery where running pending data from data flow status did not provide the correct message to the user.
* Resolved an issue where columns with date formats remained as text when the data was extracted to Excel (as xlsx extract).
* Fixed an issue where the workspace name was not fully visible.
