### Enhancements:

#### SFTP Access Enhancement:
You can now access SFTP through an SSH key for third-party imports. In addition to password-based authentication, this update introduces authentication using a private SSH key.

#### Streamlined Column Copying (Alpha Feature):
Copying multiple columns is now more efficient. Instead of creating a separate rule per column, users can use a single copy rule for multiple columns. This functionality is accessible through the transform menu and enhances workflow efficiency.




### Defect Fixes:
* Resolved an inconsistency in Branch out rule when deleting the resultant dataset.
* Fixed an issue where pipeline changes were not being reflected in the data flow status modal.
* Resolved the "Publish to DB" error that occurred.
* Fixed the continuous loader problem during the application of copy column rule through pasting.
* Third-Party Connector: Resolved the Salesforce error that was occurring when attempting to create a dataset.
* Resolved an issue where performing consecutive actions like adding, deleting, or suspending batches did not maintain the correct row count in all views
* Fixed the third-party OAuth connector identity creation redirection issue.
* Resolved the problem of copy-pasting tasks not functioning correctly for certain tasks, which was causing a loader to appear.
* Corrected the task card's display of incorrect row count for Window function tasks when "Limit ranking" was selected.
