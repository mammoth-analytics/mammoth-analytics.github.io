### Product Enhancement :

* Data Quality – Updated Layout - Improved the Data Quality layout with clearer grouping of issues, warnings, and recommendations for faster data health assessment.
* Bulk Replace – Suggestion Improvements - Enhanced group suggestions and selection experience in Bulk Replace, making it easier to identify grouped values, understand their context, and manage selections more efficiently.

### Defect Fixes :
Resolved the following issues:

* Fixed an issue where Excel data became distorted when a column contained multiple double quotes during file upload.
* Fixed an issue in Join where edited column names for imported columns were not retained, and duplicated joins did not preserve all configuration settings.
* Fixed an issue where certain uploaded files failed to process due to incorrect handling of the quote character.
* Fixed an issue in Group & Pivot where the default date format was set to Datetime (text), unintentionally changing the column type and causing confusion.
