### Product Enhancement :

#### Session Refresh Handling:
Improved session handling to detect outdated app states and prompt users to refresh, preventing unresponsive or inconsistent UI behavior.

#### Improve New Dataset Query Editor UX:
Enhanced the SQL query editor to allow direct editing without extra interactions and enabled faster query execution through improved keyboard and run behavior.

#### Dependent Views Menu in Data Editor:
Improved visibility of dependent views by ensuring Join and Lookup actions in a parent view are correctly reflected in the foreign view’s Dependent Views menu.

#### AI Prompt (Intent-Based) Action Buttons Update:
Improved clarity between Apply Now and Add to Pipeline actions to make intent-based workflows more predictable and easier to use.
