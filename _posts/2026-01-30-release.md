### Product Enhancement :

#### Dataset Settings & Preview Panel – New Design:

Improved the Dataset Settings page with updated iconography for clearer visual cues and better usability. Enhanced the Preview Panel design with refined spacing, clearer navigation indicators, and a consistent default state, making it easier to explore and understand dataset details at a glance.

#### Preserve Functions Panel State:

The Functions panel now retains its last state when reopening the Data Editor, allowing users to continue where they left off.

#### Export Hub Menu – UI Upgrade:

Updated the Export Hub menu layout with clearer grouping and improved placement of options, including a streamlined minimized and expanded view.

#### Date Format Configuration Enhancements:

Enhanced date format handling for date columns directly from the preview panel and file details view, with consistent behavior across project settings, previews, and future uploads.

#### Date Format Handling Simplification:

Simplified date format configuration in the Edit Data Settings modal by removing the automatic option and showing date format controls only for columns with ambiguous dates, reducing clutter and focusing user attention where input is required.

### Defect Fixes :
Resolved the following issues:

* Fixed an issue where intent-based sorting could result in a blank Data Editor when the pipeline is in an error state.
* Resolved a grid interaction issue where resizing column width in preview mode caused the grid to become unresponsive.
* Fixed an issue where datasets created via clipboard paste inside a folder were incorrectly created on the landing page instead of the selected folder.
* Group pivot - Corrected the column selection behavior so the column section is properly disabled when multiple aggregates are added in the Values section.
* Addressed an issue where export actions continued to be created repeatedly when invalid credentials were provided.
* Fixed an issue where copy-pasting export actions (external destinations) did not retain the configured values.
* Resolved an issue where Bulk Replace suggestions returned duplicate values.
* Restored the missing Validate action in the Edit Data Settings modal.
