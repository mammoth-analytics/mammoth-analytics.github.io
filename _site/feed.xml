<h4 id="support-for-join-with-different-column-types">Support for join with different column types.</h4>
<p>Mammoth now allows for doing join even if data types are different. This is now
supported for joining text with numeric columns and vice versa. When such a join
is done, Mammoth internally casts the joined key column to the expected type.</p>

<h4 id="support-for-single-sign-on">Support for Single sign on</h4>
<p>Mammoth now support its customers to sign in with Google besides email and password based authentication.</p>
