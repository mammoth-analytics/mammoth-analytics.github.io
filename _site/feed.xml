<p>Mammoth now warns if there are non-unique values in the key column of the joined View.

  <li>When a Branch Out Task is suspended or deleted, Mammoth deletes the contributed batch in the branched-out Dataset. This is also the behaviour now when a View containing such a Branch Out task is deleted or reset.</li>
